# Distance measurement

This tiny project I made with my daugther. When she came to me asking for a little handheld which is peeping and blinking I thought using a ultra sonic sensor could be fun.

So I sit down an draw the layout:

![3D_View](Screenshots/3D_View.png "3D_View")

in Fitzing.

The next day we put together the components and I loaded the first test sketch on the Wemos D1 mini. I have to commit that I didnÂ´t test it before.

## Ultrasonic test sketch
You can find it [here](https://github.com/alexelmi/ESP_distance_measurement/tree/main/Software/Test_UltraSonic_Simple).

## LED blinking test sketch
You can find it [here](https://github.com/alexelmi/ESP_distance_measurement/tree/main/Software/Test_LED_Simple).

## Buzzer peeping test sketch
You can find it [here](https://github.com/alexelmi/ESP_distance_measurement/tree/main/Software/Test_Buzzer_Simple).

When all components worked as they should we put the code snippets together

## Final code
